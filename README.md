# cppgfx

A simple educational C++ graphics library inspired by the Processing ecosystem

The goal of this library is to provide students with a simple programming environment, where they can learn programming while developing interesting graphics programs instead of boring console applications.

The API is inspired by [Processing](https://processing.org/), although it is not a port.
